                     <P>Wealth Effect
                        The markets get their volatile character from the price fluctuations of individual stocks. As prices increase or decrease, market volatility influences businesses and consumers.
                        
                        During a bull phase, the stock prices go up. More often than not, it boosts the economy’s overall confidence. Likewise, consumer spending also rises as individuals become more optimistic regarding the market and buy more goods and services. So, businesses offering these products and services begin to produce and sell more.
                        
                        Additionally, a larger number of investors may enter the market, which may push prices even higher. As a result, positive stock market movements can contribute towards economic development. However, this is not always the case.
                        
                        A rise in stock markets is not always coupled with economic growth. If you see 2021-22, stock markets breached all-time highs consistently, and millions of new Demat accounts opened during this period, but our growth, measured by GDP, fell in almost every quarter during the financial year. This was because of the pandemic.

    <h3>When stock market fall:</h3>
    <p>In contrast, when stock prices fall for a considerable period (known as the bear phase), they mostly affect negatively.

        Individuals may lose their optimism, with news reports on these price drops creating a sense of panic in the market. As a result, investors losing money are reluctant to spend more or turn to lower-risk assets, leading to a fall in consumer spending.
        
        </p>
    
    <h3>Participation by race and gender</h3>
    <p>The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than households headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively. As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households it was 4.3%. Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households. Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account. 14.7% of households headed by men participated in the market directly and 33.4% owned stock through a retirement account. 12.6% of female-headed households directly owned stock and 28.7% owned stock indirectly.</p>
    <p><b>Function and purpose</b></p>
    <p>The stock market is one of the most important ways for companies to raise money, along with debt markets which are generally more imposing but do not trade publicly.[20] This allows businesses to be publicly traded, and raise additional financial capital for expansion by selling shares of ownership of the company in a public market. The liquidity that an exchange affords the investors enables their holders to quickly and easily sell securities. This is an attractive feature of investing in stocks, compared to other less liquid investments such as property and other immoveable assets.</p>

    <p>The 2020 stock market crash was a major and sudden global stock market crash that began on 20 February 2020 and ended on 7 April.

<p><b>Taxation:</b>Taxation is a consideration of all investment strategies; profit from owning stocks, including dividends received, is subject to different tax rates depending on the type of security and the holding period. Most profit from stock investing is taxed via a capital gains tax. In many countries, the corporations pay taxes to the government and the shareholders once again pay taxes when they profit from owning the stock, known as "double taxation".</p><img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tLmrg3QCftmlhq9j-jnXKwAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&h=220" class="im">
